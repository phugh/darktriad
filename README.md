## Usage
```javascript
const darktriad = require('darktriad');
const opts = {
  'encoding': 'freq',
  'max': Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,
  'min': Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY,
  'nGrams': 'true',
  'output': 'lex',
  'places': 9,
  'sortBy': 'lex',
  'wcGrams': 'false',
}
const str = 'A big long string of text...';
const triad = darktriad(str, opts);
console.log(triad)
```

## Default Output Example
```javascript
{
  triad: 0.632160368,
  machiavellianism: 0.596726179,
  narcissism: 0.715042033,
  psychopathy: 0.489276573
}
```

### Errors or No Matches
If there is no input string or no matches in the lexicon, darkTriad will return null.

## The Dark Triad

### Triad Score
The 'triad' score represents a combined prediction for the three traits below.

### Machiavellianism
Named after the philosophy espoused by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli in The Prince, people who score high on this trait are cynical (in an amoral self-interest sense, not in a doubtful or skeptical sense), unprincipled, believe in interpersonal manipulation as the key for life success, and behave accordingly. Scores on measures of Machiavellianism correlate negatively with agreeableness (r= -.47) and conscientiousness (r=-.34). Machiavellianism is also significantly correlated with psychopathy.

### Narcissism
Individuals who score high on narcissism display grandiosity, entitlement, dominance, and superiority. Narcissism has been found to correlate positively with extraversion (r = .42) and openness (r = .38) and negatively with agreeableness (r = -.36). Narcissism has also been found to have a significant correlation with psychopathy.

### Psychopathy
Considered the most malevolent of the dark triad, individuals who score high on psychopathy show low levels of empathy combined with high levels of impulsivity and thrill-seeking. The similarity between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder have been noted by some researchers. Psychopathy has been found to correlate with all of the Big Five personality factors: extraversion (r = .34), agreeableness (r = -.25), conscientiousness (r = -.24), neuroticism (r = -.34) and openness (r = .24).

## The Options Object

The options object is optional and provides a number of controls to allow you to tailor the output to your needs. However, for general use it is recommended that all options are left to their defaults.

### 'encoding'

**String - valid options: 'binary', or 'freq' (default)**

N.B - You probably don't want to change this, ever.

Controls how the lexical value is calculated.

Binary is simply the addition of lexical weights, i.e. word1 + word2 + word3.

Frequency encoding takes the overall wordcount and word frequency into account, i.e. (word frequency / word count) * weight.

### 'output'

**String - valid options: 'lex' (default), 'matches', or 'full'**

'lex' returns the lexical values. See "default output example" above.

'matches' returns an array of matched words along with the number of times each word appears, its weight, and its final lexical value. See the output section below for an example.

'full' returns an object containing the lexical value and the matches array.

### 'nGrams'

**String - valid options: 'true' (default) or 'false'**

n-Grams are contiguous pieces of text, bi-grams being chunks of 2, tri-grams being chunks of 3, etc.

Use the nGrams option to include (true) or exclude (false) n-grams. For accuracy it is recommended that n-grams are included, however including n-grams for very long strings can detrement performance.

### 'wcGrams'

**String - valid options: 'true' or 'false' (default)**

When set to true, the output from the nGrams option will be added to the word count.

For accuracy it is recommended that this is set to false.

### 'sortBy'

**String - valid options: 'freq' (default), 'lex', 'weight'**

If 'output' = 'matches', this option can be used to control how the outputted array is sorted.

'lex' sorts by final lexical value, i.e. (word frequency * word count) / word weight.

'weight' sorts the array by the matched words initial weight.

'freq' (default) sorts by word frequency, i.e. the most used words appear first.

### 'places'

**Number**

Number of decimal places to limit outputted values to.

The default is 9.

### 'max' and 'min'

**Float**

Exclude words that have weights above the max threshold or below the min threshold.

By default these are set to infinity, ensuring that no words from the lexicon are excluded.

## {output: 'matches'} Output Example
(* weights and lexical values below are not representative of the actual lexicon data)

```javascript
{
  triad:
    [
      [ 'magnificent', 1, -192.0206116, -1.3914537072463768 ],
      [ 'capital', 1, -133.9311307, -0.9705154398550726 ],
      [ 'note', 3, -34.83417005, -0.7572645663043478 ],
      [ 'america', 2, -49.21227355, -0.7132213557971014 ],
      [ 'republic', 1, -75.5720402, -0.5476234797101449 ]
    ],
  narcissism:
    [
      ....
    ],
  ...
};
```
